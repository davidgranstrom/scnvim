TITLE:: SCNvim
SUMMARY:: Neovim frontend
CATEGORIES:: Frontends

DESCRIPTION::
SCNvim is a SuperCollider editor frontend for Neovim. It provides ways to
evaluate code and inspect output from the post window among other features
such as automatic function signature hints and more. The goal of this plugin
is to create an integrated development environment for SuperCollider in
Neovim.

NOTE::The following methods are usually called internally by SCNvim.::

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD::updateStatusLine
Begin polling link::Classes/Server#*default:: for CPU usage and other info.
ARGUMENT::interval
How often to poll the server. Doing this to often will impact the performance
for both SuperCollider and Neovim.
DISCUSSION::
You need to configure your teletype::statusline:: in nvim to actually see any
output. Please see the "Example configuration" section in the README of
link::https://github.com/davidgranstrom/scnvim:: This method is called by the
teletype:::SCNvimStatusLine:: command in nvim.

METHOD::generateTags
Generate a ctags compatible tag file with all SuperCollider classes and
methods. The tag file is used to look up the implementation of a class or
method using the teletype:::tag:: command.

Use teletype::CTRL-]:: to jump to the implementation for the word under the
cursor, or use teletype::gCTRL-]:: to browse between multiple matches (often
the case with methods).  
ARGUMENT::outputPath
Path to write the file.
DISCUSSION::
This method is called by the teletype:::SCNvimTags:: command in nvim.

METHOD::generateSyntax
Generate a vim syntax file containing all SuperCollider objects.
ARGUMENT::outputPath
Path to write the file.
DISCUSSION::
This method is called by the teletype:::SCNvimTags:: command in nvim.

METHOD::generateSnippets
Generate a file containing snippet definitions for all SuperCollider class constructors (*new, *ar, *fromPoints etc.).
ARGUMENT::outputPath
Path to write the file.
DISCUSSION::
This method is called by the teletype:::SCNvimTags:: command in nvim.
